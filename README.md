There are two files.

Feat.hs - A GADT-based implementation of the ideas behind FEAT (deep embedding)

Space.hs - A more direct implementation (shallow embedding), make sure to cache the functions for recursive datatypes!

The file Space.hs can be a way to understand the code that I added to Ramona's and my GF code.
